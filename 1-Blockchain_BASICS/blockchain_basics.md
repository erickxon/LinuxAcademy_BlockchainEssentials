# Introduction

`
Blockchain is a decentralized mechanism that establishes a consensus for past and current transactions, divided onto blocks. It represents a data structure.
`

## Four Characteristics
- **decentralized:** no central point of control - depends on 51% of the network 
- **transparent:** anyone has the ability to see all of the transactions
- **immutable:** not mutable unless a single entity controls 51% or more of the network
- **encrypted:** relies on cryptographic standards and algorithms to sign and very transactions and blocks

## Where is it used?
- **What are the applications of a database?**
  - banking system
  - like a database, has many applications... cannot really answer
- Ethereum: implement smaller pieces of code into the blockchain
  - Smart contracts: a piece of code with cryptocurrency inside it
    - many applications
  
## Ledger/Blockchain
### Distributed Ledger
![alt text](./ledgerblockchain.png "Ledger/Blockchain")
- each block is tied to the previous block in the chain
  - each block has the hash of the previous block (in the header)
    - this determines order of the blocks
  - payload contains the block data (transactions/events)
    - transactions/events
    - signatures
  - consensus mechanism (proof of work)

## Types of Blockchains
### Public Blockchains

- bitcoin
  - proof of work
  - anyone can:
    - read
    - write
    - participate
  - decentralized
  - append only
  - transparent
  - encrypted
  - anonymous
### Private Blockchain
  - invite only/permission-based participation
### semi-Private Blockchains
  - some parts are public
  - some parts are private
  - hybrid of public and private 
### Sidechains
![alt text](./sidechain.png "publicblockchain")
  - allow for expansion of functionality of existing blockchain
  - can be a different cryptocurrency
### Permissioned Ledger
![alt text](./permissionedledger.png "permissionedledger")
  - has a control layer functioning on top of the blockchain that has an additional layer of control
    - impose stricter/specific regulations
    - regulates things that can be done
### Distributed Ledger
![alt text](./distributedledger.png "distributedledger")
- can be private or public
- one database that is stored in every node
- every node has to vote (accept or decline changes to the ledger)
- every entry goes to the voting mechanism to determine if it is added
### Shared Ledger
- databases or applications that are shared between the people or are publicly accessible 

### Tokenized Blockchains
- blockchains that create cryptocurrency through initial distribution or minin, as the outcome of a process defined by a consensus
### Tokenless Blockchains
- not real blockchains because they lack the basic transfer of value unti
